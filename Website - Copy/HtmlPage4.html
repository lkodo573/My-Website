    <H1>Visual Basic Toturials</H1>
   <h3>Today I will show you how to use some commands for Visual Basic. 
    These will include the "Dim" command, If-then/case statements, For loops, inputs and outputs. </h3>

    <h3>Lets start with the Dim command. The Dim command can be used to declare variables. 
    An example of this could be "Answer". </h3>

    <h3>You can have different tags at the end such as integer or string. This can then be used in combination
    with an if-then to output a certain result based on a certain input. The input is whatever you type 
    into the readline and the output is what the computer puts out in the writeline. An example is shown bellow.</h3>

    <h3>An If-Then statment can be used to give a certain output based on the input, such as
    "If Answer = "one" then Console.WriteLine("OK")". Case statements also deliver a simular function. An example is shown bellow.</h3>

    <h3>As shown, you do need to have multiple Variables in order to use case statements effectivly. At the bottom you may have
    seen a {0} and a {1}. These are the variables "Emotion" and "Mood" AKA the input and the output of the Case statement. 
    The final command is a For Loop. this is used to tell the computer how much to repeat something. </h3>

    <h3>I suggest experimenting with these commands to get a feel of how they work and what the potential of them involves.</h3>
